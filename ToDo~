1- Functions: Call the variables of a function used on a transition before the slicing. Copy the function call on the transition after applying the slicing algorithm if it is needed on the sliced model.

2- Arrays: Based on the parameters and local variables of a template/module, create a new template and change the names of the parameters and local variables. Copy the name of the rest of the variables unchanged.

3- Check the following example. Sometimes it does not work properly:

A =
5,
B=4,
C=3

The slicer considers A and 5 as two different variables


4- Check why a++/a-- does not work properly.

5- add Array-name and memory to the set of used variables in the follwing case: 

Array-name[memory]= x

6- Remove system declaration of the templates which are completely removed
